# 16. Create a new classification

## Background/Motivation
A collection manager wants to create a new classification.

## Actors
Collection manager (in a wide sense) â€“ a person that uses the system to manage a collection, possibly a curator, a collection manager, a collection assistant, or data capture person.

## Preconditions
The user has classification data to add.

## Course of events
  1. The user opens a form to create a new classification.
  2. The user enters the mandatory tree name string.
  3. The user links to the higher taxon node and the origin tree. [Optional]
  4. The user specifies access rights for viewing and editing the classification. Each action can be restricted to public, workgroup/users, or private.

## Alternative paths

## Success post-conditions
The new classification record is persisted to the database and is then viewable from the user interface. The specified access rights are enforced.

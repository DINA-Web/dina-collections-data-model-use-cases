## Background/Motivation
A collection manager wants to record information about the source where an identification is found (e.g. “label attached to specimen” or a reference to a publication)

## Actors
Collection manager (in a wide sense) – a person that uses the system to manage a collection, possibly a curator, a collection manager, a collection assistant, or data capture person.

## Preconditions
The user has information about an identification's source (e.g. “label attached to specimen” or a reference to a publication). The identification has been recorded, or is being recorded.

## Course of events
  1. The user selects the identification record to edit.
  2. The user inputs the information into the appropriately labeled text field.

## Alternative paths

## Success post-conditions
The identification source information is persisted to the database and is then readable from the user interface.

## Notes
The reference should be a text field.

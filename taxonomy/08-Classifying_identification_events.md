# 8. Classifying identification events

## Background/Motivation
A collection manager wants to classify different kinds of identification events. For example, an identification event may be classified as a purely nomenclatural change, or a confirmation of an earlier identification.

## Actors
Collection manager (in a wide sense) â€“ a person that uses the system to manage a collection, possibly a curator, a collection manager, a collection assistant, or data capture person.

## Preconditions
An identification is recorded or is being recorded by the user. The user has classification data for the identification event (e.g. nomenclatural change, or a confirmation of an earlier identification).

## Course of events
  1. The user edits an identification.
  2. The user inputs the identification's classification.

## Alternative paths

## Success post-conditions
The identification's classification is recorded, and is then viewable from the user interface. Lists of identifications can be filtered by classification.

# Definition of Terms used in Use Cases

Brief definitions of terms in the use case documents. Contains links to related [DarwinCore terms](http://tdwg.github.io/dwc/terms/) (although we are not making committment to using DwC terms or any assertions about using DwC terms in exactly the same way).

## Collection manager
The person responsible for the collection.

## Collection assistant
An assistant to the [Collection manager](#collection-manager).

## Collector
The person who collected the physical [specimen](#specimen), i.e. removed it from the natural habitat. See DwC [recordedBy](http://tdwg.github.io/dwc/terms/#recordedBy).

## Curator
A person with scientific expertise who works with the [specimens](#specimen) in the collection.

## Data capture person
A person who enters data about the collection into the information management system. May not have scientific expertise about the collection.

## Determination
Making a taxonomic determination (e.g., assignment of a specimen to a taxon). Synonym of [identification](#identification). See DarwinCore  [Identification](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#Identification).

## Determiner
A person making the assignment of a specimen to a taxon.

## Identification
Synonym of [determination](#determination).

## Individual
One single organism (one genome in one body). Two specimens from the same species might be from the same individual, or from different individuals.

## Observation
A single piece of data about a specimen made at a particular time, e.g. a taxonomic identification, weight, size.

## Preparation
The type of specimen, or the process used to preserve the specimen, e.g. fossil, cast, skeleton, whole animal, etc. See DwC [preparations](http://tdwg.github.io/dwc/terms/#preparations). Can this also be used with samples?

## Sample
Part of a specimen, removed / extracted for downstream analysis (e.g. DNA sequencing). Does not correspond exactly to any Darwin Core term (would also be considered [MaterialSample](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#MaterialSample)?)

## Specimen
A physical item in a natural history collection. Primary unit in a collections management system. May include one or more taxa. See DwC  [MaterialSample](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#MaterialSample).

## Taxon
A group of organisms (sensu http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0100026) considered by taxonomists to form a homogeneous unit.
See DwC [Taxon](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#Taxon)

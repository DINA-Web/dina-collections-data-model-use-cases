Adding a determination based on an image - draft
------------------------------------------------

Background/Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some collections treat digital photos in the same way as physical collection
objects. This is often the case when the original physical material has been
lost or destroyed (like when small animals are consumed in genetic analyses).
The image then serves a valuable historical reference. As with any physical
material, an image may later be identified as a different taxon than the
current identification.


Actors
~~~~~~

**Collection manager** (in a wide sense) â€“ a person that uses the system to
manage a collection, possibly a curator, a collection manager, a collection
assistant, or data capture person.


Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A photo of a specimen that is no longer kept in the collection.

Notes

What about the use case when there is both specimen and a photo of that
specimen?

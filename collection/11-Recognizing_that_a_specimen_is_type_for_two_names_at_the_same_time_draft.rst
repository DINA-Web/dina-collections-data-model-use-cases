A specimen can be a nomenclatural type for more than one name at the same time.
This is rare, but can be seen for example in botany where two duplicate
specimens located at different herbaria has been used (unintentionally) as
types for different names.


Actors

manage a collection, possibly a curator, a collection manager, a collection
assistant, or data capture person.

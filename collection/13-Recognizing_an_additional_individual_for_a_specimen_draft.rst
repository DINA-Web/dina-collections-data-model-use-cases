Recognizing an additional individual for a specimen - draft
-----------------------------------------------------------


Background/Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physical objects may sometimes consist of unseparable individuals. These
individuals may represent the same or different taxa. An example of the latter
is a parasitic plant growing on a host plant of a different species. When a
collection manager wishes to distinguish two or more individuals (or groups of
individuals) they are usually given different catalog numbers.

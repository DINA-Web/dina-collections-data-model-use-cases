Contaminated DNA-sample
-----------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

This use case captures two different relations between a determination
and a set of physical objects: a determination may *apply to*
one set of objects, but at the same time be *based on* only a subset of
the first set.


Scope and prevalence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common for biological collections.


Use case description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. A single plant individual is dried and mounted on a herbarium sheet.
#. Three DNA-samples (labeled "sample A", "sample B", and "sample C"),
   are prepared at separate occasions from the preserved specimen.
#. The plant individual is determined as species X based on a DNA-sequence
   derived from sample A.
#. The determination to species X is considered doubtful and contamination
   of sample A is suspected.
#. The plant individual is redetermined as species Y based on new
   DNA-sequences derived from sample B and C, respectively.
#. Sample A is finally discarded after concluding that it has been
   contaminated.

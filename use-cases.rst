Contaminated DNA-sample
-----------------------

**Background:**

**Scope and prevalence:** Common for biological collections.

**Use case description:**

    1. A single plant individual is dried and mounted on a herbarium sheet.
    2. Three DNA-samples (labeled "sample A", "sample B", and "sample C"), are prepared at separate occasions from the preserved specimen.
    3. The plant individual is determined as species X based on a DNA-sequence derived from sample A.
    4. The determination to species X is considered doubtful and contamination of sample A is suspected.
    5. The plant individual is redetermined as species Y based on new DNA-sequences derived from sample B and C, respectively.
    6. Sample A is finally discarded after concluding that it has been contaminated.

# DINA use cases

Collected system use cases for the development of DINA-Web.


## Use case template

1. Title
2. Short background/motivation (why do we need this use case?)
3. Actors
4. Preconditions
5. Course of events
6. Alternative paths
7. Success post-conditions
8. Notes
9. Model treatment (how is the use case handled by different information models?)

## Use case naming

 * put use cases for a particular model into a subfolder (e.g. '[taxonomy](https://github.com/DINA-Web/dina-use-cases/tree/master/taxonomy)'
 * Use case names follow the format `[id]-[description_underscore_that_potentially_can_be_long].md`.
 * `[id]` is a 0-padded number used to quickly refer to a use case and shall be unique within the context of each module.
 * If you want to remove a use case, simply move it into a subfolder called `deprecated`.  Do not delete the file. 
 * Do not reuse numbers within a module.
 * If you want to rename a use case, keep the number and update the description.
